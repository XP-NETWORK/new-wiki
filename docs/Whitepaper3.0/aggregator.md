**Vision**

Millions have joined the cryptocurrency market in the past decade. But many are still intimidated by the NFT market's sheer diversity and unpredictability. It is still unclear to them what mechanisms drive the NFT world and what statistics are required to estimate and predict the future price of an asset. However, with the first NFT Aggregator, users without special financial or technical knowledge can rapidly pick up the insights of NFT trading and tune them to their needs as collectors or gamers or meet their trading strategy goals.

**Definition**

The first-of-the-kind NFT Aggregator brings NFT marketplaces from different chains into one location. The Aggregator not only saves time for the users. It provides them with the analyses of the whole market and individual collections and assets. Unlike traditional marketplaces, the Aggregator allows users to choose which cryptocurrency to buy assets with, even if the NFTs are located in a chain that doesn't support that currency. After the purchase, the users can transfer their NFTs to a chain of their choice. Apart from purchasing and trading, the Aggregator allows to mint NFTs for free and list them on the marketplace of the creator's choice.

**Chains and Marketplaces**

Marketplaces integration with the Aggregator is a gradual, continuous process. Therefore some marketplaces can be available before the others. Eventually, all the significant market participants will be included in the pool and participate in aggregation. Here's the initial breakdown of the marketplaces grouped by the chain of origin and the phase of the Aggregator maturity.

In the subsequent iterations of the Aggregator, we will keep integrating with the other marketplaces and other chains.

**Filters**

The aggregator allows filtering NFTs by multiple parameters bringing the most relevant results to the potential customers. The filters funnel the assets by:

- Descending (from top to bottom) <For the parameter below (where applicable)>
- Ascending (from bottom to top) <For the parameter below (where applicable)>
- Price
- Volume of Trades
- Number of bids
- Highest bid
- Most recent
- Original chain (One or several)
- Marketplace (one or several)
- Smart Contract (Name / Address)
- Collection (one or several)
- Displayed results per page

**Analyses & Statistics**

To help the users make educated decisions about the assets they wish to purchase, our trade charts and graphs illustrate different aspects of the NFT markets, such as:

- Historical prices for chains
- Historical prices for NFT collections
- Historical prices for individual NFTs
- Historical Volume of trades for chains
- Historical Volume of transactions for NFT collections
- Historical Volume of transactions for individual NFTs
- Number of distinct users

**XP.NETWORK Ownership Benefits & Cashback**

A user who staked XP.NETWORK tokens can additionally benefit from using the XP.NETWORK tools. Every transaction in the NFT Aggregator or the Bridge returns and stakes some $XP.NETWORK on behalf of the user. The cost of the bought NFT, the amount of staked tokens and the period they were staked for have a substantial impact on the size of the rewards. For more details and the rewards breakdown, see the XP.NETWORK Token Utility section of the present paper.

**Free NFT Minting**

Unlike the currently existing solutions, where NFTs are created but not minted until someone buys them, we genuinely mint NFTs assigning them unique IDs and allocating them on the minter account on the QuiChain. This transaction is easily verifiable via the QuiChain Explorer or one of the supported wallets preferred by the user. This transaction securely seals the newly minted asset ownership providing the minter with the Proof of Precedence over the adversaries who may wish to forge the NFT in the future. For more information about the QuiChain and free NFT minting, see the QuiChain chapter of the present paper.

**Further Aggregator Development**

The NFT Agregator can be further enhanced by adding a trading strategy automation tool. Hence, users could be able to authorize the NFT Aggregator to buy and sell NFTs based on several conditions or strategies:

- Falling / Rising price of the collection
- Falling / Rising volumes of sales of the collection
- The cheapest / most expensive NFTs available for sale
- Rising / Falling transaction fee rates on a chain of choice
- Time-based requests awaiting NFTs to become available for sale
